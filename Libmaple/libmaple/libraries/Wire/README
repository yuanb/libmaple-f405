The wire library has been updated to the latest source 
from the libmaple library, which now contains both a hardware and a software (bit-banged) implmentation.

**** ORIGINAL TEXT BELOW ****

Wirish soft (bit-banged) implementation of the Wire I2C library.

This implementation is synchronous, and thus supports only a subset of
the full Wire interface.  An asynchronous hardware version implemented
with DMA is expected for Maple IDE release 0.1.0.
