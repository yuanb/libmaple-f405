libmaple-f405 was developed/debugging using the following software tools, which open-source or freely-available.

These Basic instructions from the libmaple form for the development environment setup were used:  http://forums.leaflabs.com/topic.php?id=681

IDE:  Eclipse on Windows (Eclipse Juno Service Release 2), with the following plugins:

	CDT 8.1.2

Compiler:  Code Sourcery G++ Lite 4.5.2 (http://www.mentor.com/embedded-software/sourcery-tools/sourcery-codebench/editions/lite-edition/)

Debugging:

ST-LINK/V2 JTAG sofware debugger was used, this is very inexpensive and worked very well.

A gdb server that runs with the ST-LINK/V2 is available at:  https://github.com/texane/stlink

Note that the texane gdb server comes with gdb debug scripts for different targets and are included in the eclipse project file in the libmaple-f405 project; a target description file for the netduino plus 2 was added.

The debugging process used was to configure libmaple-f405 (in the Makefile) as a "jtag" target (as opposed to "flash" or "ram").  This approach worked well, with the exceptions that the project typically needs to be loaded twice due to some as-yet-undebugged issue and also  currently the jtag builds don't reserve the space for the eeprom emulation.
